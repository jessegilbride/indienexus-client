## Summary
View all artists (without having to log in), register an account, log in as your user, and create an artist profile.

Artist profiles currently allow you to have an artist name, bio (description), and ability to embed a soundcloud track or playlist. (Instructions on page for how to get the embed code.) Once the profile is created, it can be viewed in the list of artists.
